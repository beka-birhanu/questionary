I am currently working on a project to solve my own problems, which I hope will also solve other people problems too. Now I am on problem identification phase, I have some problems i have listed but I was wondering if you could help me find other people problem. The project is basically trying to make life more organized, some kind of schedule hub. Here are some problems I listed

Here is the revised list with a more logical order:

1.  **Goal Alignment**: Challenges in keeping yearly goals in mind when setting semester goals, semester goals when setting weekly goals, and weekly goals when creating daily schedules.

2.  **Privacy in Shared Goals**: Difficulty in sharing and assessing progress on selected goals with friends while keeping personal goals private, leading to demotivation.

    > **unrelated fact:** This problem is the motivation for the project

3.  **Task Overload and Prioritization**: Struggling with having too many tasks and not knowing which ones to prioritize.

4.  **Estimating Progress Metrics**: Difficulty in accurately guessing metrics for tracking personal progress.

5.  **Real-Time Progress Updates**: Lack of real-time progress updates, as current analysis is only feasible on a weekly basis due to time constraints.

6.  **Visualizing Progress**: Lack of a visual representation of progress over time, which can aid motivation and strategy adjustments.

7.  **Notifications and Reminders**: Forgetting tasks or missing deadlines due to lack of timely notifications and reminders.

8.  **Forgetting Plans**: Forgetting planned activities or tasks at home when heading to work.

9.  **Missed Alarms**: Not receiving alarms when the allocated time for a task has passed.

10. **Income and Expense Tracking**: Forgetting to record income and expenses in real-time due to the unavailability of a notebook.

11. **Historical Data Analysis**: Need to analyze past data to identify patterns and improve future planning.

12. **Calendar Integration**: Integrating with existing calendar systems to ensure all events and tasks are synchronized and easily manageable in one place.

13. **Accessibility and Cross-Device Sync**: Ensuring the tool is accessible on various devices (phones, tablets, computers) and syncs across them for efficient schedule management.

> **Note:** Some of these problems are solved by multiple other platforms, but I did not find a platform that can do all or integrate with others to achieve this.
