# These are the List of Scopes to Limit the Extent of Each Solution

## Goal Hierarchy

1. **Three Levels**: The goals will be structured into three levels: long-term, short-term, and weekly.
2. **Long-Term Goals**: These must be set within a range of 3 to 12 months.
3. **Short-Term Goals**: These must be set within a range of 1 month to the duration of the long-term goal.
4. **Weekly Goals**: These are fixed and must be written on Sundays.
5. **Daily Schedules**: These can only be set if they are part of the current week, excluding Mondays, and if they have not passed. Daily schedules are not meant for events; use the calendar for events.

## Goal Sharing

1. **Mandatory Sharing**: Users must share at least one weekly goal. They cannot start sharing from the daily schedule level.

## Updating Goals

1. **Removing Goals**: Goals can be deleted, but this action will also delete all sub-goals and schedules. To avoid this, goals can only be closed.
2. **Impact on Progress**: When goals are closed, their previous progress will still affect the overall progress.
3. **Fixed Time Allocation**: Time allocated for a goal or hierarchy cannot be extended. Users can close the goal and extend a new goal from it to maintain historical records.
4. **Sub-Goals Continuation**: When a higher hierarchy goal is closed, all sub-goals and schedules will continue to exist until explicitly closed.
5. **New Goals from Closed Goals**: Extending a new goal from a closed one will reflect all progress from the previous goal.
6. **Rearranging Daily Schedules**: Daily schedules can be rearranged unless the allocated time has passed.
7. **Editing Content**: Users can edit the content of schedules and goals, but the system will not treat the changes semantically.

## Keeping Track of Wasted Time

1. **Tracking Wasted Time**: Wasted time is collected from unchecked tasks in the daily schedule.
2. **Active Hours Metrics**: Active hours are measured based on the value of accomplished tasks.

## Metrics

1. **Metrics availability**: Metrics are only available for schedules.

## Calendar Integration

1. **Google Calendar Integration**: The integration will only be with Google Calendar.
